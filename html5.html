    <h1>1. HISTORY OF HTML</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> HTML was the brainchild of Sir Tim, getting its origins
            from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
        </li>
        <li> The first official specification was published by the
            Internet Engineering Task Force was HTML 2.0. The role
            of the IETF was superceded by the
            <strong>W3Consortium</strong>, which published the HTML
            4.01.
        </li>
        <li> The next revision was <strong>XHTML 1.0 (extensible
            HTML)</strong> (The XHTML only allowed for tags to be
            written in small letters. There was browser support for
            CSS).
        </li>
        <li> Then there was XHTML 1.1 which couldn’t be served with
            a mime-type of text/html. Later, there was XHTML 2.0
            which was not backward compatible with current content
            then
        </li>
        <li> As an aggressive rebellion against this principle of
            strictness, the <strong>Web Hypertext Application
                Technology Working Group</strong> (WHATWG)
            championed the creation of what is now HTML5.
        </li>
        <li> The WHATWG is creating an HTML5 specification using its
            process of "commit then review", while the W3C HTML
            Working Group is taking that specification and putting
            it through its process of "review then commit".
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>2. DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF HTML5</h1>

    <h2>THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML5 provides support for previous content</li>
        <li>Do not reinvent the wheel</li>
        <li>Pave the cowpaths. "If it is not broken, do not fix it"</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SIMPLICITY</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unlike in other previous versions of HTML and XHTML declaring
            the document type is easy:
            <pre>!DOCTYPE html</pre>
            This allows for backward compatibility with browsers that
            support previous versions of HTML and XHTML
        </li>
        <li>In defining the character encoding in HTML5, you do it as so:
            <pre>meta charset="UTF-8"</pre>
            in order to ensure the server
            sends the correct <strong>Content Type</strong> header.
        </li>
        <li>In defining the "script" you do so as without adding the
            <pre>type="text/javascript"</pre>
            statement in the opening "script"
            tag
        </li>
        <li>Same goes for the stylesheet where you don't need to put the
            <pre>type="text/css"</pre>
            statement in the opening "link"
            tag
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>OBSOLETE AND DEPRECATED ELEMENTS AND ATTRIBUTES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> means no longer used, while
            <strong>OBSOLETE</strong> means it's not used in modern browsers
            but is used anyway for the sake of older browsers
        </li>
        <li>Some of the obsolete elements include: <strong>frame</strong>,
            <strong>frameset</strong>, <strong>noframes</strong> and <strong>
                acronym</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Presentational elements such as <strong>font</strong>, <strong>
            big</strong>, <strong>center</strong> and <strong>strike</strong>
            are
            also obsolete
        </li>
        <li>Similarly, presentational attributes such as <strong>bgcolor
        </strong>, <strong>cellspacing</strong>, <strong>cellpadding
        </strong> and <strong>valign</strong> are obsolete.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>big</strong> element is obsolete but the <strong>small
        </strong> element isn’t. This apparent inconsistency has been
            resolved by redefining what "small" means. It no longer has the
            presentational connotation, "render this at a small size."
            Instead, it has the semantic value, "this is the small print,"
            for legalese, or terms and conditions.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>b</strong> element used to mean, "render this in bold".
            Instead it is used for some text "to be stylistically offset
            from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance".
            If the text has any extra importance, then the
            <strong>strong</strong> element
            would be more appropriate. Similarly, the <strong>i</strong>
            element no longer means "italicize." For emphasis, use
            the <strong>em</strong> element.
        </li>
        <li>The <strong>cite </strong> element has been redefined in HTML5.
            Where it previously meant "a reference to other sources", it now
            means "the title of a work".
        </li>
        <li>In HTML5, you can wrap multiple elements in a single <strong>a
        </strong> element.
        </li>
    </ul>
