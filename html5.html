<h1>HTML5 FOR WEB DESIGNERS</h1>

<h1>CHAPTER 1: HISTORY OF HTML</h1>
<ul>
    <li> HTML was the brainchild of Sir Tim, getting its origins
        from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
    </li>
    <li> The first official specification was published by the
        Internet Engineering Task Force was HTML 2.0. The role
        of the IETF was superceded by the
        <strong>W3Consortium</strong>, which published the HTML
        4.01.
    </li>
    <li> The next revision was <strong>XHTML 1.0 (extensible
        HTML)</strong> (The XHTML only allowed for tags to be
        written in small letters. There was browser support for
        CSS).
    </li>
    <li> Then there was XHTML 1.1 which couldn’t be served with
        a mime-type of text/html. Later, there was XHTML 2.0
        which was not backward compatible with current content
        then
    </li>
    <li> As an aggressive rebellion against this principle of
        strictness, the <strong>Web Hypertext Application
            Technology Working Group</strong> (WHATWG)
        championed the creation of what is now HTML5.
    </li>
    <li> The WHATWG is creating an HTML5 specification using its
        process of "commit then review", while the W3C HTML
        Working Group is taking that specification and putting
        it through its process of "review then commit".
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>CHAPTER 2: DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF HTML5</h1>

<h2>THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h2>
<ul>
    <li>HTML5 provides support for previous content</li>
    <li>Do not reinvent the wheel</li>
    <li>Pave the cowpaths. "If it is not broken, do not fix it"</li>
</ul>
<h2>SIMPLICITY</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Unlike in other previous versions of HTML and XHTML declaring
        the document type is easy:
        <pre>!DOCTYPE html</pre>
        This allows for backward compatibility with browsers that
        support previous versions of HTML and XHTML
    </li>
    <li>In defining the character encoding in HTML5, you do it as so:
        <pre>meta charset="UTF-8"</pre>
        in order to ensure the server
        sends the correct <strong>Content Type</strong> header.
    </li>
    <li>In defining the "script" you do so as without adding the
        <pre>type="text/javascript"</pre>
        statement in the opening "script"
        tag
    </li>
    <li>Same goes for the stylesheet where you don't need to put the
        <pre>type="text/css"</pre>
        statement in the opening "link"
        tag
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>OBSOLETE AND DEPRECATED ELEMENTS AND ATTRIBUTES</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> means no longer used, while
        <strong>OBSOLETE</strong> means it's not used in modern browsers
        but is used anyway for the sake of older browsers
    </li>
    <li>Some of the obsolete elements include: <strong>frame</strong>,
        <strong>frameset</strong>, <strong>noframes</strong> and <strong>
            acronym</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>Presentational elements such as <strong>font</strong>, <strong>
        big</strong>, <strong>center</strong> and <strong>strike</strong>
        are
        also obsolete
    </li>
    <li>Similarly, presentational attributes such as <strong>bgcolor
    </strong>, <strong>cellspacing</strong>, <strong>cellpadding
    </strong> and <strong>valign</strong> are obsolete.
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>big</strong> element is obsolete but the <strong>small
    </strong> element isn’t. This apparent inconsistency has been
        resolved by redefining what "small" means. It no longer has the
        presentational connotation, "render this at a small size."
        Instead, it has the semantic value, "this is the small print,"
        for legalese, or terms and conditions.
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>b</strong> element used to mean, "render this in bold".
        Instead it is used for some text "to be stylistically offset
        from the normal prose without conveying any extra importance".
        If the text has any extra importance, then the
        <strong>strong</strong> element
        would be more appropriate. Similarly, the <strong>i</strong>
        element no longer means "italicize." For emphasis, use
        the <strong>em</strong> element.
    </li>
    <li>The <strong>cite </strong> element has been redefined in HTML5.
        Where it previously meant "a reference to other sources", it now
        means "the title of a work".
    </li>
    <li>In HTML5, you can wrap multiple elements in a single <strong>a
    </strong> element.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>CHAPTER 3: RICH MEDIA</h1>

<h2>THE CANVAS, VIDEO & AUDIO ELEMENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        In HTML5, instead of installing a plugin on the browser you can
        use <strong>"canvas"</strong> element to create dynamic images.
        This means that contents within the "canvas" tags are updated
        based on user actions. Create a canvas and define the dimensions
        and give it an id which will be used by JScript to reference the
        it and its context (the context being the dimensional view of
        the image):
            <pre>
                Sample Image Without Canvas
                <img src="31b89e34659297d06133f2cceeaef4fc.jpg"
                     alt="Sample Image">
                Sample Image Within the Canvas
                <canvas id="sample-image" style="border: 1px dashed black">
                    <img src="31b89e34659297d06133f2cceeaef4fc.jpg">
                </canvas>
            </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        However, since every document on the web is described by a
        Document Object Model, which has some important nodes such as
        the <strong>element</strong>, <strong>text</strong> and
        <strong>attribute</strong> nodes, and since the canvas has no
        DOM, the contents within it cannot be accessed i.e. are not
        visible.
    </li>
    <li>The "Audio" element
            <pre>
                Sample Audio File
                <audio src="Afire_Love.mp3" controls autoplay></audio>
                The controls and their functionality can be extended using
                javascript
            </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The "Video" element
            <pre>
                <p>Sample Video File</p>
                <video
                        src="Alesso%20-%20Heroes%20(we%20could%20be)%20ft.%20Tove%20Lo.mp4"
                        controls width="360" height="240" autoplay></video>
            </pre>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>CHAPTER 4: WEB FORMS</h1>

<h2>The <em>"Placeholder"</em>, <em>"Autofocus"</em> and
    <em>"Required"</em> Attributes</h2>
<form action="dummy.html" autocomplete="off">
    <label>Name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" autofocus required>
    <br />
    <label>Password: </label>
    <input type="password" name="pass" placeholder="Password" required>
    <input type="button" value="Submit">
</form>

<h2>THE DATALIST</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The new "datalist" element allows you to crossbreed a regular input
        element with a select element. Using the list attribute, you can
        associate a list of options with an input field
    </li>
</ul>

<form action="dummy.html" autocomplete="off">
    <label>Name: </label>
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" autofocus required>

        </strong>, <strong>search</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, <strong>tel
        </strong>, <strong>range</strong>, <strong>number</strong>, <strong>date
        </strong> and<strong>color</strong>.
