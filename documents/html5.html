        <h2>CHAPTER 1: HISTORY OF HTML</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> HTML was the brainchild of Sir Tim, getting its origins
                from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).
            </li>
            <li> The first official specification was published by the
                Internet Engineering Task Force was HTML 2.0. The role
                of the IETF was superceded by the
                <strong>W3Consortium</strong>, which published the HTML
                4.01.
            </li>
            <li> The next revision was <strong>XHTML 1.0 (extensible
                HTML)</strong> (The XHTML only allowed for tags to be
                written in small letters. There was browser support for
                CSS).
            </li>
            <li> Then there was XHTML 1.1 which couldn’t be served with
                a mime-type of text/html. Later, there was XHTML 2.0
                which was not backward compatible with current content
                then
            </li>
            <li> As an aggressive rebellion against this principle of
                strictness, the <strong>Web Hypertext Application
                    Technology Working Group</strong> (WHATWG)
                championed the creation of what is now HTML5.
            </li>
            <li> The WHATWG is creating an HTML5 specification using its
                process of "commit then review", while the W3C HTML
                Working Group is taking that specification and putting
                it through its process of "review then commit".
            </li>
        </ul>

        <article>
            <h3>THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML5 provides support for previous content</li>
                <li>Do not reinvent the wheel</li>
                <li>Pave the cowpaths. "If it is not broken, do not fix it"
                </li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>SIMPLICITY</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike in other previous versions of HTML and XHTML
                    declaring
                    the document type is easy:
                    <pre>!DOCTYPE html</pre>
                    This allows for backward compatibility with browsers that
                    support previous versions of HTML and XHTML
                </li>
                <li>In defining the character encoding in HTML5, you do it as
                    so:
                    <pre>meta charset="UTF-8"</pre>
                    in order to ensure the server
                    sends the correct <strong>Content Type</strong> header.
                </li>
                <li>In defining the "script" you do so as without adding the
                    <pre>type="text/javascript"</pre>
                    statement in the opening "script"
                    tag
                </li>
                <li>Same goes for the stylesheet where you don't need to put
                    the
                    <pre>type="text/css"</pre>
                    statement in the opening "link"
                    tag
                </li>
            </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>OBSOLETE AND DEPRECATED ELEMENTS AND ATTRIBUTES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> means no longer used, while
                    <strong>OBSOLETE</strong> means it's not used in modern
                    browsers
                    but is used anyway for the sake of older browsers
                </li>
                <li>Some of the obsolete elements include:
                    <strong>frame</strong>,
                    <strong>frameset</strong>, <strong>noframes</strong> and
                    <strong>
                        acronym</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Presentational elements such as <strong>font</strong>,
                    <strong>
                        big</strong>, <strong>center</strong> and <strong>strike</strong>
                    are
                    also obsolete
                </li>
                <li>Similarly, presentational attributes such as <strong>bgcolor
                </strong>, <strong>cellspacing</strong>, <strong>cellpadding
                </strong> and <strong>valign</strong> are obsolete.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>big</strong> element is obsolete but the
                    <strong>small
                    </strong> element isn’t. This apparent inconsistency has
                    been
                    resolved by redefining what "small" means. It no longer has
                    the
                    presentational connotation, "render this at a small size."
                    Instead, it has the semantic value, "this is the small
                    print,"
                    for legalese, or terms and conditions.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>b</strong> element used to mean, "render this
                    in bold".
                    Instead it is used for some text "to be stylistically
                    offset
                    from the normal prose without conveying any extra
                    importance".
                    If the text has any extra importance, then the
                    <strong>strong</strong> element
                    would be more appropriate. Similarly, the
                    <strong>i</strong>
                    element no longer means "italicize." For emphasis, use
                    the <strong>em</strong> element.
                </li>
                <li>The <strong>cite </strong> element has been redefined in
                    HTML5.
                    Where it previously meant "a reference to other sources",
                    it now
                    means "the title of a work".
                </li>
                <li>In HTML5, you can wrap multiple elements in a single
                    <strong>a
                    </strong> element.
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In HTML5, instead of installing a plugin on the browser you
                    can
                    use <strong>"canvas"</strong> element to create dynamic
                    images.
                    This means that contents within the "canvas" tags are
                    updated
                    based on user actions. Create a canvas and define the
                    dimensions
                    and give it an id which will be used by JScript to
                    reference the
                    it and its context (the context being the dimensional view
                    of
                    the image):
            <pre>

            </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, since every document on the web is described by a
                    Document Object Model, which has some important nodes such
                    as
                    the <strong>element</strong>, <strong>text</strong> and
                    <strong>attribute</strong> nodes, and since the canvas has
                    no
                    DOM, the contents within it cannot be accessed i.e. are not
                    visible.

                    Some new text-level semantics have also been added to vast

                    3. Meter - can be used to mark up measurements, provided
                    that those
                    measurements are part of a scale with minimum and maximum
                    values.
                    <br/>
                    9 out of 10 cats

                    <br/>
                    4. Progress - allows you to mark up a value that is in the
                    process
                    of changing. You can add min max and value attributes to
                    the
                    opening
                    progress element if you like

                    The section element is used for grouping together
                    thematically-related content. While the div has no semantic
                    meaning, i.e. it is simply a generic container, a section
                    is used
                    explicitly for grouping related content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The header element is a container for content in the
                    masthead. This
                    means that there is only one masthead but there can be more
                    than
                    one
                    header in it. You can also use the header element within a
                    section
                    element, for example.
                </li>

                <li>
                    The footer element contains information about its
                    containing
                    element:
                    who wrote it, copyright information, links to related
                    content, etc.

                    Just like header elements HTML5 allows for more than one
                    footer
                    within a section
                </li>
                <li>
                    The aside matches the concept of a sidebar. But it’s the
                    content
                    that matters, not the position. The aside element should be
                    used
                    for
                    tangentially related content. If you have a chunk of
                    content that
                    you consider to be separate from the main content, then the
                    aside
                    element is probably the right container for it. Pullquotes
                    are a
                    good example of tangentially related content; they’re nice
                    to have,
                    but you can remove them without affecting the comprehension
                    of the
                    main content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The nav element contains navigation information, usually a
                    list of
                    links. The nav element is intended for major navigation
                    information
                    such as site-wide navigation. Quite often, a nav element
                    will
                    appear
                    within a header element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The article element is another specialized kind of section
                    and is
                    used for self-contained related content. The article
                    element is
                    specifically designed for syndication. If you use a time
                    element
                    within an article , you can add an optional pubdate Boolean
                    attribute to indicate that it contains the date of
                    publication. The
                    article element is useful for blog posts, news stories,
                    comments,
                    reviews, and forum posts. It covers exactly the same use
                    cases as
                    the hAtom microformat. The article element should be used
                    for self
                    contained widgets: stock tickers, calculators, clocks,
                    weather
                    widgets, and the like.

                    The hgroup element allows you to use heading elements
                    without
                    having them appear in the document outline. The blockquote
                    ,
                    fieldset , and td elements are all immune to the outline
                    algorithm.
                    These elements are called “sectioning roots”
