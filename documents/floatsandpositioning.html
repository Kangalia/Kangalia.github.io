        <h2>Floating</h2>

        <p>Float values include: left, right, inherit, none Floated
            elements affect the flow of the document although they are
            on a different plane from the rest of the document. Margins
            around floated elements do not collapse.

            It is a general rule that floated elements do not move
            outside the inner margins of their containing elements.
            However it is possible to implement this behaviour using
            negative margins.

        Floated elements tend to overlap other content. Therefore,
        in order to create a distinct boundary between floated element
        and other elements you can implement a “clear” for those
        elements so that then they are pushed to their own space on the
        document below the floated elements. Available options for
        “clear” include: left, right or both.
